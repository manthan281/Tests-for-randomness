# Tests-for-Randomness

These are some of the tests used for testing randomness of a random number generator

1) Kolmogrov Smirnov test
   It is a goodness of fit test and is used for testing whether the random numbers generated from random number generator follow uniform distribution or not

2) Runs test
   It is used to test the independence of random numbers

3) Poker test
   It is also used to test the independence of random numbers

4) Spectral test
   It is a graphical test and is used to test the k-dimensional uniformity of random numbers
   
Here, the various tests mentioned above are performed on linear congruential generators, RANDU generator and also on randoms numbers generated from R
